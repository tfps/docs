TFPS Documentation
=======================================

The telephony fraud prevention system was created in 2014 on top of a simple idea, grab the information from honeypots and crowdsourcing and create a system capable to detect and interrupt in real time telephony fraud. It was designed primarily to fight IRSF (Internet Revenue Share Fraud) for ITSPs (Internet Telephony Service Providers) based on the SIP protocol. The system is now on its third generation.

1st Generation based in the SIP redirect Mechanism
2nd Generation based on SIP Redirect and Failover(503/603)
3rd Generation primarily Restful API or access to the restful API via SIP Client, SIP Redirect or SIP routing (503/603)

Right now, our recommendation is to use the tfps sniffer with the Restful API. It is the simplest and most powerful way.
